            <p>While banking, insurance, and financial services are being redefined by major disruptions, traditional methods of customer acquisition, engagement and retention are also evolving rapidly. This means a massive overhaul of existing business models is imminent and innovation is key to handling this change. </p>

            <h2><a href="#">TELECOMMUNICATIONS</a></h2>
            <p>The key challenge in front of a telecom operator today is not how to better connect its customers, but how to better connect with its customers.
